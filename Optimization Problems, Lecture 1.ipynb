The next metric is by how cheap an item is, i.e cheapest item packed first and the last metric is highest density, i.e high value-low cost, item first which gives a similar result as the second metric \n",

Because in this case with the 1000 calorie constraint it did give the \"best\" solution because we get the highest value of foods for the same calorie constraint.
